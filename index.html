  <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
  <p class="abstract">
    While soft robots offer intrinsic compliance and safety, controlling them poses fundamental challenges due to high dimensionality, strong nonlinear and time-varying dynamics, and partial observability. Many learning-based controllers tackle these challenges with complex architectures, yet often suffer from multi-solution ambiguity, distribution shift, and compounding error over long horizons. We pursue a deliberately minimal alternative. We learn a simple dynamics model directly from experimental data for compliant motion, and embed it into a novel iterative Model Predictive Path Integral controller (I-MPPI). In each control cycle, I-MPPI performs multiple short-horizon, uncertainty-aware sampling updates that progressively refine the control sequence via importance weighting, mitigating model bias and long-horizon error accumulation while keeping computation lightweight. This simple two-component design—model learning with iterative sampling-based MPC requires few assumptions, avoids large policy networks or differentiable simulators, and is easy to implement and tune. Experiments on a multi-segment soft robot show real-time, robust, and high-precision trajectory tracking under disturbances and parameter variations, highlighting the practicality and deployability of minimal learning-based control for soft-robotic systems.

  <h2>METHOD</h2>

  <h3>The proposed I-MPPI architecture</h3>
  <p>
    The overall architecture consists of a learned simple model and an iterative MPPI controller. 
    In each control cycle, multiple short-horizon sampling and weighted updates are performed, 
    and only the first action is executed. This iterative sampling progressively reduces the 
    exploration range, improving stability and accuracy.
  </p>

  <h3>Simple model</h3>
  <p>
    The model is a compact one-step forward predictor (MLP), trained directly from robot interaction data. 
    The dataset includes steady-state responses, random excitation, and trajectory tracking runs to ensure 
    sufficient coverage of the operating envelope.

  <h3>Iterative MPPI</h3>
  <p>
    The controller builds upon MPPI, but performs multiple refinement iterations per cycle and 
    applies a warm-start strategy to reduce variance and accelerate convergence.
  </p>

  <h3>Iterative annealing</h3>
  <p>
    In each iteration, the sampling noise scale is gradually reduced, transitioning from 
    coarse exploration to local fine-tuning. This annealing mechanism reduces jitter and 
    improves steady-state precision.
  </p>

  <h3>Hardware of soft robot</h3>
  <p>
    The experimental platform is a multi-segment rigid–flexible soft robot, equipped with nine pneumatic 
    actuation units and corresponding drivers, as well as an optical tracking system for real-time feedback.
  </p>

  <h2>EXPERIMENTS ON REAL ROBOTS</h2>

  <h3>Trajectory tracking</h3>
  <p>
    We evaluated circular, square, and figure-eight reference paths, comparing theoretical trajectories 
    with actual execution. The results show that the method achieves millimeter-level accuracy across 
    all paths, with the best performance on smooth references.

  <h3>Moving target tracking</h3>
  <p>
    Eight sequential targets were placed near the workspace boundaries. The robot converged to 
    each target quickly, with average errors on the order of a few millimeters. Errors were 
    larger for diagonal targets, consistent with stronger coupling and larger actuation ranges, 
    but overall performance followed expected modeling trends.
